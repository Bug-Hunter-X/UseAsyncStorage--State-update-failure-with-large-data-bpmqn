This bug occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook with a large amount of data.  The hook may fail to update the state correctly, leading to stale data or unexpected behavior.  This often happens when setting data that exceeds a certain size limit, causing the asynchronous operation to silently fail.  It manifests as the state not reflecting the changes made to AsyncStorage.
